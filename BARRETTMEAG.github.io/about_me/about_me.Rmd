# **About Me (Meaghan)**
I am a senior bioinformatics major studying at Utah Valley University. I am currently undecided about graduate school. My hope is to be involved in plant research at the government level. I enjoy biology, especially growing plants. My dream career really would be a government scientist.

# **Current Research**
Examining who is the king of attacking humans. The data is pointing to sharks being king, but wolves and alligators are catching up, especially since the alligator data is missing a large chunk of attacks.
